Dominic Graf navigates this challenge brilliantly. His style is subtly poignant, cold-bloodedly brisk, yet quietly...",

Although he has a PhD in literature, he can only work in a newspaper and is dismissed by his boss on the grounds that he is only fit for literature and not for practical work. His good friend Labourd was doing a post-doctorate in literary theory. I suppose in the 1930s two such people would have been considered high intellectuals. In the grey post-war social climate, most people were unemployed, living from hand to mouth, lascivious and lost in their spiritual worlds because of the hardships of life and the fears of war. Fabian and Labourd are, I think, the only two idealists in the film. Labourd, who is from a wealthy family, cannot bear the betrayal of his fiancée because of his mental cleanliness, loves her but cannot accept his...",

It is a literary and historically-influenced reportage of the time, with reminiscences and imagery (interspersed with montages) that pull the viewer back and forth between reality, history and story, yet still moving along with the plot. The main character, Fabian, is kind, sincere, principled, idealistic, compassionate and empathetic. This is a man of good nature who lives in a grey historical context of war, social decay, living in a flat, chaos, grotesquerie and noise, and meeting all kinds of people. When he meets love, he is unable to fight the reality of financial hardship, and his girlfriend leaves him to pursue her own business...",

A portrait of the multitude of literary PhDs, film actors, painters, pimps, bar performers ...... in Germany two years before the Nazis came to power. A group of people most sensitive to destruction and being destroyed. Unemployed, lost a lover, best friend committed suicide and finally died in a self-inflicted accident on the way to hope. If life is so cruel, what is the point of living? Is it to run towards destruction? What can we do if we can avoid it? In fact, nothing can be done, because this is the type most vulnerable to destruction, which is the hardest wound of the literati, and even more so the sadness of the director. Would the world be better off without the literati? The director is so desperate that you can feel it through the screen...",
